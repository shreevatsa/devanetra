* Planning

* Transliteration

Code already exists:

- [[http://shreevatsa.appspot.com/sanskrit/transliterate.html][my script]] from 2010 or earlier
- [[sanscript.js][https://github.com/sanskrit/sanscript.js]]
- [[https://github.com/mbykov/salita][salita]]

* Chrome extension

Reading https://developer.chrome.com/extensions now.

Looks like we just need to [[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contextMenus][add a context menu]] and then we can execute arbitrary JS code in the ~onClicked~ callback, with the reference to the ~selectionText~.

The problem is replacement, as the selected text can span multiple divs in different styles.

It also looks like we need a [[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/overview#contentScripts][content script]].

But note that [[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts][content scripts]] cannot directly call the Chrome API (like attaching a handler to the context menu onclick), so we also need an [[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages][event page]] (see point 7 on that page, about context menus).

We might be able to use [[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/activeTab][activeTab permission]] instead of asking for permissions on all pages.

See samples at [[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples][Sample Extensions]].
